        <h2>Final Writeup</h2>
        <p>For this project, we developed an interactive visualization to explore the effects of neurodegenerative diseases on gait asymmetry. Our goal is to analyze gait asymmetry through three metrics: stride interval, swing interval, and stance interval.
            Our dataset was titled <strong>Gait in Neurodegenerative Disease Database</strong> and includes data from:</p>
        <ul class="stats-list">
            <li><strong>15</strong> subjects with Parkinson’s disease</li>
            <li><strong>20</strong> with Huntington’s disease</li>
            <li><strong>13</strong> with ALS</li>
            <li><strong>16</strong> healthy control group subjects</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Visualization Approach</h3>
        <p>We used a scatterplot to display our findings, analyzing the following six metrics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Average Left Stride Interval (sec) vs. Average Right Stride Interval (sec)</li>
            <li>Average Left Swing Interval (sec) vs. Average Right Swing Interval (sec)</li>
            <li>Average Left Stance Interval (sec) vs. Average Right Stance Interval (sec)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We mapped left-side metrics on the y-axis and right-side metrics on the x-axis (for example, Left Swing vs. Right Swing), allowing users to track gait asymmetry in individual subjects. We took the averages of every individuals’ left and right gait metrics. </p>

        <h3>Comparison of Visualization Methods</h3>
        <p>We initially tried using a histogram and a bar chart to visualize our findings, but decided that a scatter plot provided the most insight. The histogram only showed the left-to-right ratio distribution, and the bar chart only summarized the data for each disease. The scatterplot, on the other hand, allowed us to compare the ratios for each individual subject.</p>

        <h3>Key Insights</h3>
        <p>A reference line, <strong>y = x</strong>, was added to indicate perfect symmetry. Points above this line represent individuals with a higher left-side metric, while points below indicate the opposite. This helps users quickly identify asymmetry trends across different diseases.</p>

        <h3>Color Coding & Interactivity</h3>
        <p>Each disease group is color-coded based on its awareness ribbon:</p>
        <div class="color-coding">
            <span class="color-box gray"></span> Parkinson’s (Purple)
            <span class="color-box blue"></span> Huntington’s (Blue)
            <span class="color-box red"></span> ALS (Red)
            <span class="color-box black"></span> Healthy Control (Black)
        </div>
        <p>Interactive features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Filtering:</strong> Users are able to select and deselect disease groups to focus on specific comparisons. This allows for a focused comparison (for example, comparing only Parkinson’s and ALS or comparing all four groups at once)</li>
            <li><strong>Tooltip Feature:</strong> Provides more detailed information on the individual: Hovering over a data point reveals the exact values for that subject. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We initially considered creating separate scatterplots for each disease, allowing side-by-side comparisons. However, we realized that combining all the disease groups into a single scatterplot per metric would be a better idea, as it simplifies comparison across diseases by consolidating data into a single plot and making patterns more apparent.</p>

        <h3>Development Process</h3>
        <p>Our team worked together closely throughout the project. For the checkpoint submission, each group member created 1-2 plots. We then spent several hours brainstorming the final visualization and deciding which features to implement, how to increase interactivity, and how to structure our GitHub page. </p>
        <p>We split the major tasks:</p>
        <ul class="team-roles">
            <li><strong>2 team members</strong> – Implemented the visualization using D3.js.</li>
            <li><strong>2 team members</strong> – Designed the website's UI and wrote the project report/writeup.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even though we divided the tasks, we worked together in person and constantly communicated, asked questions, debugged issues, and clarified next steps.</p>

        <h3>Time Commitment</h3>
        <p>The entire project, including the checkpoint, took approximately <strong>20 hours</strong>. The most time-consuming aspects were implementing D3.js and debugging the event listener functionality.</p>
